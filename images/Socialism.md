Is when a population collectively owns and controls the means of production, and distributes the end result proportionally

* A system used by both Nazis and Finland
* Control is maintained of the state
* The idea was to remove social inequality
	* In the US better schools cost more so higher class of people got better education. Where as in Finland education is free and everyone is given the same opportunities
* The idea was to get rid of social classes and make all people equal
* Socialism comes in different forms
	* One of the first schools of socialist thought was **utopian socialism** that is vague in itself
		* This think thought that factory owners and other would voluntarily hand over means of production to workers.
		* The end result would be that production would be controlled by the collective and decentralized democracies
		* This idea focused too much on theoretical models of how it might work but no how to achieve it
	* Socialism can even be seen used in other philosophies, even Capitalism
		* This is because there is a system where a democratic government protect socialistic ideals like civil rights, equal education, and environmentalism
	* **Libertarian Socialism** has the focus of a state that's either small or decentralized or completely non-existent
		* A common form is Anarchism which appose hierarchy and authoritarian all together
			* Even Anarchism has it's own variations such as **Anarch syndicalism** which started Catalonia, Spain before ww2. this was a small success story of people living functionally without Capitalism and money. People were wealth for the state and quality healthcare for it's 2.5 million inhabitants
	* **Social democracy**
		* Equal rights and opportunities
		* State-run welfare system
		* Capitalist economy
	* **Marxism** is a philosophical word view and way to analyze politics/society/economy
		* It is centered around class struggle, revolution, and materialism
		* It views are more production are taken by for force, rather than negotiation or other forms of slower transition.
		* Often misinterpreted because of the Soviet Union or Communists achieved
	* **Marxism-Leninism**
		* Dictatorship of the porletariat
		* Benefit to stateÂ  = benefit for people
		* in practice the ruling party can allow citizens to suffer for the state
* Because Socialism is so broad some of its ideals
	* can even be compared to Buddishm
		* all living this are interconnected and interdependent and all humans should be treated equally and kindness
	* Plato had some of the simple ideas of socialism during his time asking for the government action to create higher taxes to social problems and the redistrubtion of resources
	* Christianity in the new testament speak on Jesus advocating that all people should provide for the poor and distribute resources according to peoples needs
		* "All who believed were together and had all things in common, and they sold their possessions and goods and divided them among all men, as every man had need" Acts 2:44-45
		* "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor" Matthew 19:21
	* In early days it was seen more of a philosophy than a political system
