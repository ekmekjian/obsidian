* It started as a channel on PetTube, a channel for bloggers that own many pets
* For Nicole Dean this channel was her means of doing something with her live
* She had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connectivity tissue disorder
	* The weakness in her tissues made it easy to hurt herself such as dislocate joints
	* " On one time, I woke up and thought I had a cold, so I went to the doctor and they found out I had shattered my clavicle in my sleep"
* When she started posting to pettube her popularity started to rise
	* There were those who adopted pets because of her.
* It started with a party she was invited too because of her youtube fame. This was where she tried coke for the first time and found herself wanting it all the time
* After some time she met someone online who's music she was a fan of
	* He was addicted to opiods and she took what he had. Since then she never went back to coke
* She told herself "It's a prescription drug, it can't be that horrible"
* Things got worse for her relationship.
	* he was being distant and locking himself in rooms taking only a spoon
* She wanted to help him even offered to pay for the rehab
* Instead he offers her heroin and promises it would be the end of it afterwards
	* She said yes
* She started using more and more trying to justify it with the fact that she still had her home but was barely doing anything on youtube
* Jonny Craig (the boyfriend) told vice that she was never forced and that they were addicted together and the break up was amicable
* It was in her own videos did viewers find out about her addiction
	* Within her videos, when zoomed in, needles were seen in the background
* She tried to deny it as other youtubers try to expose her and make it known that the animals could not be cared for by an addict
* Eventually she came out about it. Some even supported her recovery and told stories of their better choices thanks to her
