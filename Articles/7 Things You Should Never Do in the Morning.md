### Highlights

- “Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it.”
- If you want to make the most out of each day, set your priorities before going to bed.
- Quite often, we don’t even realize that negative conversations and thoughts can influence us for hours.
- But if you start your day by complaining about your job, partner, family, or whatsoever, you’ll take that negative mood with you for at least a few hours, sometimes even for the entire day.
- By complaining, you focus on obstacles and problems, which makes it harder to recognize opportunities. It’s nothing more than a surefire way to start your day on the wrong foot.
- If you start your day by complaining, you’ll find more and more things to complain about throughout the day. Not because there is so much to complain about, but because you focus on it.
- f you, however, focus on the bright side of life, you’ll come across even more things that will cheer you up and boost your happiness.
- However, the truth is that most of the time, sleeping for a few more minutes will only leave you even lazier, make you slow, and cut your productivity.
- Instead of getting up and rushing to work, take some time to do things that will benefit your physical and mental health.
- In his book 12 Rules for Life, Jordan Peterson describes how his clients experienced a drop in anxiety when they switched from breakfasts with high amounts of carbohydrates and sugar to fat and protein-rich meals.
- Simple carbohydrates and sugars are digested too quickly, lead to a sudden spike in blood sugar, followed by a quick dip.
