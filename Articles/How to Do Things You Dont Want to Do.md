### Highlights

- I once read that your mind is merely a suggestion box, and you have the power to veto any thought or impulse. Our brains are highly influenced by cognitive biases, and while we might think we view the world objectively, we’re always thinking subjectively.
- How much would you accomplish if you started relying on your discipline and good habits rather than temporary thoughts and feelings?
- And quit I did, because the more I did it, the harder the training was. Instead of pursuing a sport that brought me genuine joy, I gave in to my discomfort and thoughts and decided that maybe my mind was right. I should give it up. It was really hard.
- The best way to practice mental resistance is through voluntary hardships. It’s by doing the things nobody else wants to do. It’s by going to the gym every morning at 5 am when the world is still asleep. It’s by running 3 miles when you can barely run 1. It’s by forcing yourself to read that self-help book even though you’d rather do absolutely anything else.
