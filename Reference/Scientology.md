# Dianetic

*   There are two sides of a brain
    *   Analytical - the flawless part
    *   Reactive - where fear and anxiety are stored which come from Engrams
        *   Engrams - like a memory that you carry
            *   for example if you were in auto accident and you still feel you are still recovering from the accident, that is the engram. It's similar to carrying a burden
*   You could be carrying fear and anxiety even form past lives
*   To be Clear meant remove all burdens from your current and past lives

# Auditor

*   a practitioner
*   The job of one is to listen
*   The auditor would ask deep questions in order to provoke thought then use the E-Meter to measure the mass of the thoughts
*   If a person imagines an image and the E-Meter registers it the Auditor would inquire further. If you imagined a barn they would ask "What does the barn look like?" and the E-Meter's reaction would determine if the this thought was a real event, from another life

### Auditing proccess

*   Every auditing consisted of interviewees get asked more, and more personal questions
*   By the time you were well into the church they had your entire life on paper.
*   The most damaging to a member were seprated  in to a folder

## E-Meter

*   Similar to a lie detector. An E-Meter doesn't measure respiration and pulse
*   Used to measure the mass of thoughts
*   2 cans each connected to electrical wires carrying with an indetectable amount of current into  a meter with a needle registering the amount of mass in thoughts. The amount of mass in thoughts would supposedly generate resistance in the circuit
    *   No study show that thoughts generate mass

## Operating Thetan(OT)

*   a spiritual being
*   The highest level is 8
*   At 3 you were able to read secret hand written material from Ron Hubbard
    *   Kept in a locked breifcase
    *   The material spoke about a Galactic Overlord that would capture people and imprison them on Earth, which was a prison planet

## Creation Myth

*   75 million years ago there world where life was like America in the 1950s
*   This world, like ours, had an overpopulation problem
*   Zenu was their elected supreme ruler
*   Zenu would call people at random in order to freeze them, box them, fly to the prison planet (Earth), drop them into volcanoes, then drop hydrogen bombs on the volcanoes.
*   Then Thetans( the spirits from the bodies) would float out find a new born and inhabit them
    *   Some new borns would carry more than one Thetan
    *   This is why we have such fears and anxiety

### Scientology's response to creation My

[DO SCIENTOLOGISTS BELIEVE THEY ARE DESCENDED FROM ALIENS?](https://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-in-society/do-scientologists-believe-they-are-descended-from-aliens.html)
"Absolutely not. Scientology holds no such belief. Any suggestion otherwise is as absurd as asserting that those of the Christian faith believe themselves descended from aliens because they believe there is a Heaven. 

Some of the information one finds on the Internet concerning Scientology religious beliefs is a mixture of misstatements, distortions and outright lies designed to twist Scientology theology. These scurrilous statements, issued by the “Internet fringe,” are not only patently untrue, they are intentionally designed to ridicule Scientologists and denigrate their actual religious beliefs."

## David Miscavige

*   Current head of the church
*   he was the middle man between Hubbards hiding place and the church delivering messages

    *   They would have members cleaning, brushing, constantly were breathing paint fumes, and eat what ever was left over
    *   Beds were on the roof, out in the open, they were moldy and soggy
        *   A spokesperson called it a "Great Program"
    *   Those with childeren had their kids sent into a "Cadet" program so they wouldn't be a burden to their parents re-programming
*   With their biggest members, like Travolta, members of the action group would work those that manage their lives, such as managers and PR members, inorder to silence those that made their lives difficult
    *   Being with the church meant having their protection
*   In Legal battles John Travolta even defended them in court
*   L. Ron Hubbard never paid taxes for Scientology because he believed it to be a religion and should be tax-exempt

        *   She was considered a Potential Trouble Source (PTS)
    *   Tom strayed from the church for a movie "Eyes Wide Shut" and was less in contact with David Miscavige (the leader)
        *   The church sent members to bring Tom back close to the church by trying to end his relationship with Nicole Kidman.
        *   They would audit him over and over again getting as much info to David as possible because he didn't like the idea of Tom straying
        *   They tapped Nicole's phone when Tom had doubts
    *   by 2004 Tom was awarded a medal in order to put him out in the public more
    *   They onced helped arrange a relationship after Nicole. It was unstable and the church ended the relationship for him
*   Jason Beghe was a member for a long time until he realized what all the auditing was doing to his mental health and finally left in 2007
