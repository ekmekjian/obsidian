*   Breatharianism can be seen being referenced since 1972 in a book by Dick Gregory who only reference the term when talking about different styles of diets and using the term as a parody
*   1981 Wiley Brooks popularized the term when he lifted 3x his body weight and claiming in and interview that he had not eaten for 17 years
    *   Though there never any specifics on the rules of the diet Wiley himself created them
    *   People paid to watch him speak
    *   He co-authored a book that detailed some of the ways one can be part of the diet such as the "yellow food diet" to purify the blood of poison before one could mature into breatharian
        *   Some of the foods were Haagen-Dazs rum-rasin ice cream, eggs, corn.
*   Michelle Pfeiffer joined Wiley's group she claimed the group was controlling and financially draining. She admitted that it had been a cult
*   1983 One member admited to sneaking junk food to Wiley at night and another said they saw him eat an omelette and continued to around them.
*   Naveena Shine wanted to prove live without eating using light as nutrition
    *   Others have done something similar such as taking nutrient the body needs through breathing alone
*   Those that believe breathing is all that is needed are called breatharianism
*   This was a big idea that some have gained fame for
    *   One name was Hira Ratan Manek and Indian that clamied to have eaten for over a decade. In 2011 was photographed at a restaurant
    *   ellen greve (later changed to Jasmuheen) prana but she ate sometimes. Had thousands of followers
*   In 2013 at age 65 Naveena started a light only diet
*   These people who follow this plan believe this to be some path to enlightenment
    *   Those that followed this "**prana**" plan in the first week experienced extreme fatique, kidney pain, and feeling their mouths were glued shut
*   Few have died from this "diet"
    *   one falling into a coma
    *   another experienced speech loss, and paralysis and eventually death
    *   After a week another died of dehydration
*   When reports of these issues came to these gurus they claim that these feelings were natural and it was the "bad spirit" leaving them and that the plan would guarantee them a new body ready to get all it's nutrients from the universe
*   Jasmuheen referred anyone claiming that the diet doesn't work to her books and website both stating the criteria for being able to take part of the program calling those that qualify as "feeling the presence of the Divine One within"
*   In an attempt to denounce Jasmuheen 60 minutes challenged her to 7 days to take part in the diet while under full watch
    *   After two days a doctor that visits her weekly warned her of dehydration and high blood pressure. Jasmuheen claimed it was because of city polution. 60 minutes relocated her
    *   She lost 13 pounds despite not looking well but she claimed she was feeling well
    *   After 4 days the experiment ended by doctors orders
*   Her followers believed that nothing was disproven
*   Naveena who was influenced by Jasmuheen to take on the experiement started her own but was allowing herself water
    *   In the end of her 3rd week she was feeling ill from drinking too much water
*   Naveena streamed her entire home with a setup that put her in debt
*   After 21 days she lost 21 pounds and claimed to have told her body to "stop losing weight"
*   During an interview she could feel comfortable and needed to lie down
*   Both Naveen and Wiley have stated that those who felt like they were dying were because the believed they were and that's why they did
*   In her second month Naveena was having doubts but she stayed committed
*   Eventually she announced that she was adding creamer to her tea that many believe tainted the experiment
*   at day 42 she lost 32 pounds despite telling her body to stop losing weight
*   She ended the experiment at day 44, she admitted that there are dangers but still thought it could be possible
