    *   His story was consistent saying that he said his mother's head hurt and that she couldn't see
*   When she stopped at a gas station she was looking for pain meds but ended up leaving with nothing
*   A bottle of vodka was in the van
    *   No one seemed to know about it
*   The family hired a private investigator paying upwards of 30k
    *   The family states they took the money and disappeared. they did the work with tests, interviews, and obtaining footage

*   The family found dental records which they believe was the cause of her driving, not the alcohol,
    *   The husbands hope is that the tooth pain was sever enough to cause a stroke that led to the accident. In a meeting with an expert it was said that the alcohol found in her system takes precedence
