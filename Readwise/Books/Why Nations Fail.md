## Highlights
- To realize their long-term purpose of seizing all the available gold, the Spaniards employed their usual strategy of apportioning among themselves (or en-commending, as they have it) the towns and their inhabitants … and then, as ever, treating them as common slaves. The man in overall command of the expedition seized the King of the whole territory for himself and held him prisoner for six or seven months, quite illicitly demanding more and more gold and emeralds from him.

- The strategy and institutions of conquest perfected in Mexico were eagerly adopted elsewhere in the Spanish Empire. Nowhere was this done more effectively than in Pizarro’s conquest of Peru. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=347))
- Pizarro began on the coast near the Peruvian town of Tumbes and marched south. On November 15, 1532, ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=351))
- They killed Atahualpa’s guards and retainers, possibly as many as two thousand people, and captured the king. To gain his freedom, Atahualpa had to promise to fill one room with gold and two more of the same size with silver. He did this, but the Spanish, reneging on their promises, strangled ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=355))
- the mita, especially the Potosí mita, was to become the largest and most onerous scheme of labor exploitation in the Spanish colonial period. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=373))
- The road to Calca is surfaced, the one to Acomayo is in a terrible state of disrepair. To get beyond Acomayo, you need a horse or a mule. In Calca and Acomayo, people grow the same crops, but in Calca they sell them on the market for money. In Acomayo they grow food for their own subsistence. These inequalities, apparent to the eye and to the people who live there, can be understood in terms of the institutional differences between these departments—institutional differences with historical roots going back to de Toledo and his plan for effective exploitation of indigenous labor. The major historical difference between Acomayo and Calca is that Acomayo was in the catchment area of the Potosí mita. Calca was not.

- The full gamut of encomienda, mita, repartimiento, and trajin was designed to force indigenous people’s living standards down to a subsistence level and thus extract all income in excess of this for Spaniards. This was achieved by expropriating their land, forcing them to work, offering low wages for labor services, imposing high taxes, and charging high prices for goods that were not even voluntarily bought. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=398))
- English began their colonization of North America at exactly the same time. But they were already latecomers. They chose North America not because it was attractive, but because it was all that was available. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=410))
- As the winter of 1607 closed in, the settlers in Jamestown began to run low on food, and the appointed leader of the colony’s ruling council, Edward Marie Wingfield, dithered indecisively. The situation was rescued by Captain John Smith. Smith, whose writings provide one of our main sources of information about the early development of the colony, was a larger-than-life character. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=433))
- He initiated a series of trading missions that secured vital food supplies. On one of these he was captured by Opechancanough, one of Wahunsunacock’s younger brothers, and was brought before the king at Werowocomoco. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=443))
- Smith’s life was saved only at the intervention of Wahunsunacock’s young daughter Pocahontas. Freed on January 2, 1608, Smith returned to Jamestown, which was still perilously low on food, until the timely return of Newport from England later on the same day. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=446))
- was Smith who was the first to realize that the model of colonization that had worked so well for Cortés and Pizarro simply would not work in North America. The underlying circumstances were just too different. Smith noted that, unlike the Aztecs and Incas, the peoples of Virginia did not have gold. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=450))
- Virginia Company to take firmer control over the locals. Their plan was to crown Wahunsunacock, hoping this would render him subservient to the English king James I. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=456))
- The whole event appears to have been a complete fiasco, with the only thing coming out of it a resolve on the part of Wahunsunacock that it was time to get rid of the colony. He imposed a trade embargo. Jamestown could no longer trade for supplies. Wahunsunacock would starve them out. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=461))
- The Virginia Company was intended to be a moneymaking enterprise, and after two disastrous years, there was no whiff of profit. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=472))
- replacing the ruling council with a single governor. The first man appointed to this position was Sir Thomas Gates. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=473))
- The new mode of governance left no room for Smith, who, disgruntled, returned to England in the autumn of 1609. Without his resourcefulness, and with Wahunsunacock throttling the food supply, the colonists in Jamestown perished. Of the five hundred who entered the winter, only sixty were alive by March. The situation was so desperate that they resorted to cannibalism. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=475))
- It was Dale who propagated the “Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall.” This included the clauses No man or woman shall run away from the colony to the Indians, upon pain of death. Anyone who robs a garden, public or private, or a vineyard, or who steals ears of corn shall be punished with death. No member of the colony will sell or give any commodity of this country to a captain, mariner, master or sailor to transport out of the colony, for his own private uses, upon pain of death. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=479))
- If the indigenous peoples could not be exploited, reasoned the Virginia Company, perhaps the colonists could. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=485))
- Men were housed in barracks, and given company-determined rations. Work gangs were chosen, each one overseen by an agent of the company. It was close to martial law, with execution as the punishment of first resort. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=487))
- In 1618 the company began the “headright system,” which gave each male settler fifty acres of land and fifty more acres for each member of his family and for all servants that a family could bring to Virginia. Settlers were given their houses and freed from their contracts, and in 1619 a General Assembly was introduced that effectively gave all adult men a say in the laws and institutions governing the colony. It was the start of democracy in the United States. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=499))
- In 1632 ten million acres of land on the upper Chesapeake Bay were granted by the English king Charles I to Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore. The Charter of Maryland gave Lord Baltimore complete freedom to create a government along any lines he wished, with clause VII noting that Baltimore had “for the good and happy Government of the said Province, free, full, and absolute Power, by the Tenor of these Presents, to Ordain, Make, and Enact Laws, of what Kind soever.” ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0058Z4NR8&location=509))

- Just as the attempt to impose draconian rule in Virginia failed, so did the plans for the same type of institutions in Maryland and Carolina. The reasons were similar. In all cases it proved to be impossible to force settlers into a rigid hierarchical society, because there were simply too many options open to them in the New World. Instead, they had to be provided with incentives for them to want to work. And soon they were demanding more economic freedom and further political rights.
