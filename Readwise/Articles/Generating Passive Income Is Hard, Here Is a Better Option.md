## Highlights
- Generating enough passive income to cover your living expenses takes years, if not decades.
- the only true source of passive income comes from income generated by investments.
- What most people think of as passive income is actually “scalable income,” which is another way of saying business income. There is no limit on how much you can earn, but you aren’t guaranteed a dime.
- Saving 20% of your income, starting at age 30, would mean you would have enough passive income to cover your living expenses by age 68. What I am describing has a name; it’s is called retirement planning.
- Reducing your living expenses has the exact same impact on your finances as increasing your passive income
