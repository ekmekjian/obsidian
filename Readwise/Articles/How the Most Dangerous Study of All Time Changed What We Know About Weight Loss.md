## Highlights
- men volunteered to starve to help scientists understand the effects of starvation and how to bring starving people back from the brink.
- Their bodies saved those calories by doing less of the stuff that kept them healthy. Their heart rates dropped by a third and their body temperatures by three degrees, making them feel freezing cold even in the heat. They stopped replacing cells in their blood, skin, and organs. Their hearts shrank an estimated 17 percent, and they lost 40 percent of their muscle.
- The participants were all irritable, depressed, and discontent. They had awful nightmares. One of the men even cut off three of his fingers while operating a saw (he said he wasn’t sure if he did it on purpose).
- They reported intense cravings and said that the food they did eat was much tastier than it was before the starvation period. A few became preoccupied with recipes. One said that he “stayed up until 5 a.m. last night studying cookbooks.” Many started smoking or constantly chewing gum to curb their food obsession. The researchers finally had to ban gum after one guy was chewing 30 packs of it a day.
- Our desire to exercise drops and we’re less inclined to, for example, take a walk, get up and down, and fidget (this spontaneous movement can burn hundreds, even thousands of extra calories a day). The most important point is that this all occurs unconsciously. We don’t even realize that we’re moving less in our day-to-day life
