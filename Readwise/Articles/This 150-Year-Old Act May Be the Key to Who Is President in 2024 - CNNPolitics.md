## Highlights
- For his part, Pence has repeatedly insisted his hands were tied by the Constitution. "I will always be proud that we did our part on that tragic day to reconvene the Congress and fulfilled our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States,"
- It's also why some Republican Senators appear to be open to updating the law in advance of the 2024 presidential race. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the most powerful Republicans in the chamber, told Axios on Tuesday that there was "some interest" among his colleagues for reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887. On Wednesday, Thune went further, telling CNN's Manu Raju that "I think the role of vice president needs to be codified, so it's clear what that is." Thune added that no bipartisan talks about reforming the Electoral Count Act had begun as of yet.

- The specific language comes from the US Code -- and was put in place following the 1876 presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden. In that race, four states -- Oregon, Louisiana, Florida and South Carolina -- submitted two slates of electors, reflecting disputes between the two parties over who actually had won. A commission was formed to decide which slate of electors should be recognized; Hayes won by a vote of 8 to 7 on that commission -- and became president.
- In the wake of that close and contentious election, a movement began to clarify the language related to the counting of the Electoral votes in the Constitution. "The president of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted," reads Article II, Section 1.
- "If more than one return or paper purporting to be a return from a State shall have been received by the President of the Senate, those votes, and those only, shall be counted which shall have been regularly given by the electors who are shown by the determination mentioned in section 5 of this title to have been appointed, if the determination in said section provided for shall have been made, or by such successors or substitutes, in case of a vacancy in the board of electors so ascertained, as have been appointed to fill such vacancy in the mode provided by the laws of the State; but in case there shall arise the question which of two or more of such State authorities determining what electors have been appointed, as mentioned in section 5 of this title, is the lawful tribunal of such State, the votes regularly given of those electors, and those only, of such State shall be counted whose title as electors the two Houses, acting separately, shall concurrently decide is supported by the decision of such State so authorized by its law." Clear as mud, right? What the passage seems to stipulate is that when there are two conflicting sets of electoral slates from a state, the one that has been affirmed by the governor of the state ("the lawful tribunal") should be the one that the House and Senate recognize as lawful unless both chambers vote to reject that slate for whatever reason.
