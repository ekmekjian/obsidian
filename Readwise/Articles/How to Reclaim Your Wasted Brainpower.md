## Highlights
- The data collected showed that having your phone out on the desk on silent (when performing a task that your phone is not needed for) can reduce your working memory capacity by 11% and fluid intelligence by 7%.
- At the end of the study, researchers asked every participant to rate how much they thought the presence or lack of presence of their phone affected their performance. 75.9% said “not at all” and 85.6% said that it “neither helped nor hurt their performance.” Yet, the group with phones out of the room measurably outperformed the group with their phones on the desks.
