## Highlights
- Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. In both cases, the body’s immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger.
- Cases of myocarditis reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)external icon have occurred: After mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), especially in male adolescents and young adults More often after the second dose Usually within a week of vaccination
- Both myocarditis and pericarditis have the following symptoms: Chest pain Shortness of breath Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart
- CDC continues to recommend that everyone ages 5 years and older get vaccinated for COVID-19. The known risks of COVID-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death, far outweigh the potential risks of having a rare adverse reaction to vaccination, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis.
