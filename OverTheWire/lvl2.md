The password is in a file called "spaces in this filename" located in home directory.
password: rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi

## Notes
Spaces in linux terminal are read as additional arguments.

To deal with this you can either wrap the file name in quotes or use a backslash to escape the space.
example: `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename` or `cat "spaces in this filename"`
