-   Working within the limits of the SCOTUS decision. 
-   NAACP plexus vs Ferguson was overturned in 1954 by Brown vs Board of education

-   The biggest overturning of the separate but equal act. 
-   Took naacp 60 years to overturn
-   They focused on the equal of “separate but equal” 
-   Planned parenthood vs danforth

-   Women needed consent to get an abortion
-   Minors needed parents consent
-   SCOTUS struck it down
-   So adjusts we’re made so that all you had to do was just tell parents with their consent

-   This was passed

-   In the 80s Anti-Abortion had many victories

-   Federal funds could not be used for most abortions. 
-   Webster vs reproductive services

-   Restricting money to facilities that did abortions. This was on a state level
-   Now women needed to pay for it themselves 

-   Restricting federal funding led to abortion going from being a right to a “liberty interest” 4 scotus justices agreed. This was a big step to overturning roe vs wade

 # 1992

-   Planned parenthood vs Casey 

-   Pen had restriction on abortion 
-   Women had to tell their parents or partner and wait 24hrs 
-   Because of the Webster case it was argued abortion was not a right so abortion could be regulated to a degree
-   SCOTUS sided with roe vs wade but made a change that states could regulate abortion as long as the state wasn’t denying most women frivolously “Undue burden”

-   This modification to roe vs wade allowed the anti abortion group to push the limits of roe again by looking for more ways to pass some regulations. 

-   Since the 90s three justices have Ben confirmed then in 2022 Roe vs Wade was overturned

-   It’s now up to the states to decide the law
-   One goal is to make abortion a criminal offense but many states will not uphold those laws.
