## Frames
- a container/wrapper for a chunk of data moving across a network.
-   there are different types of frames
-   DOCSIS
-   All NICs must transmit the same frame type or they won't be able to communicate with each other
-   A frame carries: Recipients MAC address|Senders MAC address|Type|Data|FCS
	-   The first two are self explanatory
	-   Type tells whats inside the frame	
	-   Data is the purpose of our transmission(what we are actually sending)
	-   [[FCS]] is a frame check sequence and is used by the NIC to determine if the frame came in intact
-   Over a wired connection frames can hold up to 1500 bytes of data anything bigger is chopped up into frame size. The data chopping is handled by the system's software
-   Thanks to this size limit other NICs on the network are able to transmit their frames with out trouble from big files.
