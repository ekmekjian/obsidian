-   Frames from NICs are sent here for transportation
    
-   On early versions of a central box they were called 'hubs' and when a frame was a received the hub would make a copy of the frame and send it to all ports except the port the frame was received from but only the device with the same MAC address as the recipients address inside a frame will be able to actually processÂ  the frame
    
-   Hubs were replaced by switches which, unlike a hub, sends frames to the port that has that matches the MAC address in the frames
