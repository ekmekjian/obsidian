## Media Access Control address
-   a unique identifier that is used to identify a specific piece of hardware

-   also known as a physical address
    
-   no two devices share the same address
    
-   companies will request MAC address from the IEEE(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) . Each one is unique and will tied only to the NIC its burned into. No other manufacture will have the same addresses as others.
    
-   Some devices have MAC address visibly printed on their surface.Will be printed as ######-######
    
-   MAC address format: ##-##-##-##-##-##
	-   MAC address are written in [[Hexadecimal 1]]
	- the first six digits represent the number of the NIC manufacturer also know as Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
	-   the last six are the manufacturer's unique serial number for that NIC also known as "device ID"
-   The name space for this format was originally called MAC-48(48 referring to how many bits the MAC address will be comprised of) but was later changed to EUI-48 because the IEEE could trademark it but its still widely refereed to as MAC
-   MAC addresses are typically used on smaller network partly because a network of thousands of computers sending broadcast signals or even just hundreds would take so much of the networks bandwidth barely any data of value would get through
